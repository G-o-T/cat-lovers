# React and redux app 'Cat lovers'

This SPA contains a list of cards, each of which displays a picture and information that came from the endpoint (I used 'The Cat API' (https://thecatapi.com/) and Redux to store, modify and retrieve incoming data).
All cards have a 'like' icon (when clicked, the icon changes color) and a 'delete' icon (when clicked, the card is deleted).
In addition there are:
- a 'filter' button (when clicked, shows only liked cards);
- a loader that shows the user that the download process is in progress.
The SPA has adaptive design.
